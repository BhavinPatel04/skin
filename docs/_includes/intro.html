                <h3>Evolutionary</h3>
                <p>eBay's cohesive multi-screen experience starts with a shared and unified design system. As this system evolves, so too does Skin, meaning apps only need to keep their Skin package updated to ensure the latest look and feel.</p>

                <h3>Adaptive</h3>
                <p>Screens 7" and below are considered to be <em>small</em> screens; they are our default, baseline experience. Screens over 7" are <em>large</em> screens. Skin provides support for large screens in an <a href="#adapters">adaptive</a> manner.</p>

                <h3>Accessible</h3>
                <p>Skin leverages semantic HTML, SVG, ARIA roles, states and properties to apply our styles wherever possible, thus enforcing correct, accessible semantics.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid__cell grid__cell--one-half">
                <h3>Readable</h3>
                <p>Skin follows the <a href="https://en.bem.info/method/key-concepts/">BEM</a> principles of Block, Element and Modifier to ensure our class name and class structure is human readable and understandable.</p>

                <h3>Decoupled</h3>
                <p>Skin is decoupled from the JavaScript layer, meaning that HTML and CSS should not need to be reimplemented every time the JS frontend framework changes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid__cell grid__cell--one-half">
                <h3>Open</h3>
                <p>Skin operates under an open source model. GitHub allows any developer to contribute bug fixes, features, suggestions and ideas. Join the community and get involved!</p>
