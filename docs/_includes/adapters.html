<div id="adapters">
    <h2>Adapters</h2>
    <p>Skin takes advantage of <a href="https://github.com/lasso-js/lasso#conditional-dependencies">conditional dependencies</a> in Lasso.js, to provide <em>adaptive</em> CSS for every component.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Skin itself <strong>does not</strong> do any detection of browser size or capabilities, therefore it is the responsibility of the application logic (typically via device detection service) to detect which adapters are needed.</p>

    <h3>Skin Large</h3>
    <p>Skin is built for small screens first (7" and below). Styles for larger screens (i.e. desktop) are <strong>not</strong> supplied by default.</p>
    <p>To meet the conditional dependency for large screen styles, Lasso.js requires the <span class="highlight">skin-large</span> flag.</p>

    <h3>Skin DS</h3>
    <p>Skin has the capability to switch between previous, current and upcoming design systems at a component level.</p>
    <p>More information coming soon.</p>
